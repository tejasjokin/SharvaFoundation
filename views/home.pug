          | Sharva is delighted to announce that we have successfully reached another milestone with our Blood drive. For this event, members of our family courageously came forward and donated blood towards a noble cause. We appreciate these 2 members on behalf of SHARVA Family and congratulate them for their participation for a good cause. In such testing time, doing such things isn’t any less than noble and with this we hope more and more people will come forward to help save a life.

          | Sharva Foundation will be exploring a new segment in the coming months, called ‘PROJECT GREEN’. As cool and exciting the name sounds, it’s actually pretty simple and fun to begin with. PROJECT GREEN categories everything including planting trees, collecting up and dumping of waste, cleaning of any region or even doing the slightest of things which will make our surroundings a little more pleasant. See, it was that simple.
